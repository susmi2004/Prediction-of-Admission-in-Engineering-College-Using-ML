# Prediction-of-Admission-in-Engineering-College-Using-ML
This project helps students predict admission chances into engineering colleges using their rank, category, gender, preferred college, and branch. It uses ML models trained on past data, with a frontend in HTML/CSS/JS and a Flask-SQLite backend using Random Forest for accurate, personalized predictions.
